      <h2>A Reconnaissance of the 1874 Black Hills Expedition</h2>
      <p></p><img src="media/BlackElk-Smithsonian.jpg" style="float:left;width:50%;padding:10px;"/>
        During the summer of 1874, two separate groups of people traveled through Paha Sapa, the Black Hills. The first consisted of Oglala
        Lakotans, and it included the well-known visionary Black Elk. Thes econd was a much larger column of heavily armed soldiers, who
        numbered over one thousand men and were led by George Armstrong Custer. This was only six years after the signing of the Treaty of
        Fort Laramie, wherein the United States formally recognized Lakotan sovereignty in the region.
      </p>
      <p>
        Their reasons for going to the Black Hills could not have been any more different. The military expedition was sent there to find gold,
        to make a map of the region, and to locate a suitable spot for a fort. In contrast, Black Elk and his relatives went to the Black Hills to
        cut lodge poles for tipis.
      </p>
      <p>
        While the two never came face to face, they did interact indirectly. Many years later, Black Elk
        <a href="https://www.nebraskapress.unl.edu/bison-books/9780803265646/" target="_blank">recalled</a>
        that “we saw some whites going toward the Black Hills,” and everyone in camp agreed “they should 
        get together and do something about the gold-diggers.”
      </p>
      <p>
        For their part, expedition soldiers knew they were being watched. On the 6th of July, 1874,
        <a href="https://search.worldcat.org/title/2754212" target="_blank">the diary</a>
        of a Private named Theodore Ewert recorded “a party of Sioux Indians” in the vicinity, which he felt sure had been “posted here as a ‘corps
        of observation’ on the movements of our expedition.”
      </p>
      <p>
        Although they were brief, these fleeting encounters indicate that Lakotan people knew what was going on in their treaty lands. This
        leads to a fascinating question: how did they understand one of the most infamous military expeditions in American history?
      </p>
      <p>
        On the hundred and fiftieth anniversary of these events, the
        <a href="https://www.nativecairns.org/index.html" target="_blank">Center for American Indian Research and Native Studies</a>
        has teamed up with the
        <a href="https://library.brown.edu/create/cds/in-and-out-of-place-resource-extractions-from-treaty-lands/"
            target="_blank">Brown University Center for Digital Scholarship</a>
        to document what happened in the 1868 treaty lands during the summer of 1874. Rather than rehash well-worn stories that are better left 
        behind, we want to take our cue from Black Elk and try something different. By keeping a close eye on the expedition’s movements, we
        can learn a great deal about Lakotan history and culture. That is ourvgoal: to turn the extractive goal of this expedition back on itself,
        mining the rich archive of documentary records that it produced to ask what it reveals about the history of the 1868 treaty lands. We look 
        forward to having you along for the journey!
