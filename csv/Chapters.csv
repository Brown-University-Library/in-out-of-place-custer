1 JULY 1874: Ft. Abraham Lincoln,Fort Abraham Lincoln,7/1/1874,7/2/1874,46.76944444,-100.8491667,11,Plain,green,"On the first of July, Custer emerged from his headquarters and issued the order to depart at 8am the next day. This “caused great rejoicing in camp,” especially among the expedition’s “civilian attaches.” Apparently, a new shipment of guns had been slow to arrive, which caused a delay lasting more than one week. Although this was “decidedly irksome,” Custer sought to maintain morale among scientists and others who had joined the expedition “on the invitation of the commanding officer, and without pay from the Government” by hosting frequent soirees at his residence in the camp.<br></br>According to the New York World, the camp was also stirred up by an impassioned protest from Episcopal Bishop Hare and other so-called “friends of the Indians,” who accused the expedition of being in “direct defiance and violation” of the 1868 Treaty of Fort Laramie. Although the New York World dismissed the controversy as mere “rumors” spread by “disappointed filibusters and sensation mongers,” the newspaper nonetheless acknowledged that it would have been “graceful to notify the Indians of our intention.” Similar sentiments were also voiced by Theodore Ewert, an expedition soldier, who complained that by ordering an “invasion of the Black Hills,” the United States “forgot its honor,” its “sacred treaty,” and its “integrity.”<br></br>Around the same time, a group of Eastern Dakota (Santee) scouts joined the expedition at Fort Lincoln. According to the New York World, this occasioned a large “war dance” to celebrate an “alliance of the tribes” among the expedition’s Native scouts.<br></br><a href=""https://scalar.usc.edu/works/in-and-out-of-place/index"" target=""_blank"">Learn more.</a>",,media/1July-FtAbrahamLincoln.png,"Broken glass negative plate showing Ft.

A soldier named Theodore Ewert recalled how troops were lined up in four columns with “guidons” flying in the breeze while a band played ""Garry Owen"" and officers “dashed up and down the column with an air of importance.” Anxiously chattering with one another, the troops looked back and saw the wives of officers and enlisted men waving their handkerchiefs in farwell. Next they let out “three hearty cheers” and began marching southwest along the banks of the Heart River. A cavalry scout named Luther North recalled being surprised by the expedition’s festive mood overall. He wrote in his diary that “this was the first and last expedition that I was ever on in an Indian country that had a band along,” adding that Custer often ordered the musicians to assemble in front of his tent after supper and play for an hour or so.<br></br>The large column of men included ten companies of mounted cavalry, three companies of infantry soldiers, about one hundred Native scouts, and a battery of Gatlin guns followed by approximately one hundred and fifty wagons carrying supplies. As they marched over some fifteen miles of rolling prairie, a reporter for the New York World noted several trails which had been “cut deep and stamped hard” by “the extinct buffalo,” whose “bones are everywhere to be found … in little bleached piles.” In addition, the expedition naturalist George Bird Grinell reported the discovery of several invertebrate fossils embedded in “yellowish sandstone” on top of a “lofty bute.”<br></br>By all accounts, it was a hard day’s march that lasted over twelve hours in total. Several soldiers passed out from heat exhaustion, and crossing the Heart River proved almost impossible with the heavy wagons and large Gatling guns. According to a correspondent for the Chicago Inter-Ocean, there was also a great deal of anxiety caused by “startling rumors” about an imminent attack from Lakotan warriors who had gathered under Sitting Bull’s leadership to prevent Custer’s men from entering the Black Hills.<br></br><a href=""https://scalar.usc.edu/works/in-and-out-of-place/index"" target=""_blank"">Learn more.</a>",Cross-referenced.,media/2July-BuckCreek.png,"Column of Cavalry, Artillery, and Wagons making up the 1874 Black Hills Expedition, photographed by William H.

Intense beams of sunlight scorched the earth and made stones so hot they “literally blister the hands.” The day’s march was made all the more strenuous by the region’s unforgiving landscape. In his official report, the geologist Newton H. Winchell described a “broken country” of fairly high altitude underlain by sandstone and strewn over with “foreign boulders.” Other accounts paint a similar picture. In his private diary, a soldier named Theodore Ewert complained about the scarcity of freshwater and lack of tree cover, claiming that soldiers were “compelled” to carry firewood over a distance of more than two miles back to the camp.<br></br>In spite of the harsh climate and difficult terrain, Custer insisted on making the military band put on a show. A correspondent for the Bismarck Tribune wondered who the intended audience of this imposing display might have been. Although “no Indians have yet been seen,” he remarked, the sight of over one thousand soldiers and several hundred horses marching in step to the music “presents a scene decidedly enlivening, and which must strike the Indian, even, with wonder and admiration.”<br></br><a href=""https://scalar.usc.edu/works/in-and-out-of-place/index"" target=""_blank"">Learn more.</a>",Approximate.,,,,https://cawm.lib.uiowa.edu/tiles/{z}/{x}/{y}.png,0.9,geojson/treatyland-1868.geojson,0.1

The fourth of July passed without fanfare or celebration. Indeed, it was a “Fourth by no means glorious,” the New York World lamented; characterized by extreme heat, no shade, and gusts of “alkaline dust” that “made our thirst intolerable, eyes sore, and faces blistered despite veils.” With the benefit of hindsight, however, one wonders if complaints such as these may have been a self-aggrandizing ploy to sell newspapers and broadcast the masculine courage, vigor, and stamina of expedition soldiers. Indeed, Aris Donaldson from the St. Paul Pioneer described a rather different scene, stating the expedition passed through a much “better country,” which was “clothed in green by recent and heavy rains,” compared to previous days.<br></br>

Overall, then, not much of note happened that day. With one exception. Private Theodore Ewert recalled crossing a trail that was cut by Custer’s expedition to the Yellowstone River the previous year. This brought back old memories in the 7th Cavalry’s ranks and “gave the boys a topic for discussion which was kept up 'till late in the night.” How would this year’s expedition compare to the last, they wondered? “Would we meet as many, or more, Indians than last year? Would the expedition be as successful as the one of the Yellowstone? How many would return? Who of our command would remain in the Black Hills?”<br></br><a href=""https://scalar.usc.edu/works/in-and-out-of-place/index"" target=""_blank"">Learn more.</a>",Approximate.,,,,https://cawm.lib.uiowa.edu/tiles/{z}/{x}/{y}.png,0.9,geojson/treatyland-1868.geojson,0.1

If the previous day had been uneventful, the fifth of July was even more tedious and routine. The only excitement consisted of two unfortunate accidents. First, there was a teamster who fell from his seat and broke both of his legs when the wheels of his wagon passed over them. Second, a rattlesnake bit a horse at its fetlock joint just above the hoof. The poor animal began dripping with sweat almost immediately and trembled so much that it nearly fell to the ground. Had it not been for the quick intervention of a veterinary doctor, the horse would have almost certainly died.<br></br>

While it may have been lacking excitement, the day was pleasant for everyone else. According to the St. Paul Pioneer, the expedition passed through as “rich and well-grassed prairie as the very best in any of the States.” Survey geologist Newton Winchell agreed, describing the “country passed through” as “the finest yet seen.” In addition to featuring “a few oaks, and good grass,” it also had “a flowing stream of clear water” that an Arikara scout named Goose called “Where the Bear Stays in Winter.”<br></br><a href=""https://scalar.usc.edu/works/in-and-out-of-place/index"" target=""_blank"">Learn more.</a>",Approximate.,,"Portrait of the Arikara Scout, Goose, taken by David Barry in 1886.",,https://cawm.lib.uiowa.edu/tiles/{z}/{x}/{y}.png,0.9,geojson/treatyland-1868.geojson,0.1
6 JULY 1874: Cannon Ball River,Cannon Ball River,7/6/1874,7/6/1874,46.33111111,-101.7952778,11,Plain,green,"March: 4:50am to 10am<br>
Mean Temp: 78.4F<br>
Distance Marched: 12.9 miles<br></br>As they had for the past several days, members of the expedition woke up in the predawn to escape from the heat and complete the day’s march before noon. Several made note of the fine country through which they passed, which was covered by “good grass” and irrigated by several small rivers and streams. It was so fertile, in fact, that Private Ewert was certain that it “will undoubtedly be settled in course of time.”<br></br>

An antelope sighting led to terrible excitement when a large number of mounted soldiers began giving chase and firing with wanton abandon. As Aris Donaldson wrote in the St. Paul Pioneer, “a great deal of wild shooting was done and a great deal of Uncle Sam's ammunition was wasted.” When soldiers in charge of a Gatlin gun abandoned their post, their work-horses spooked and took off for the prairie, accidentally pulling the large-caliber guns and discharging them in every direction at great risk to the entire company. As punishment, several mounted soldiers were forced to continue marching on foot, and Custer issued an order that forbade anyone from firing their gun within five hundred yards of the company’s flank.<br></br>

In addition to fertile land and abundant game, several members of the expedition also recorded encounters with the region’s native inhabitants. Ewert, for example, claimed to have met “a party of Sioux Indians” who “were eager in their protestations of peace.” He refused to believe they were just hunting on account of the fact that “none of their squaws were with them, and it is well known that without their ‘fair sex’ to do the drudgery the Sioux Indians hunt no game.” Instead, he was convinced the small party had been “posted here as a ‘corps of observation’ on the movements of our expedition.” But “as orders had been issued for us to act simply on the defensive, we did not disturb them.”<br></br>

Writing in the St. Paul Pioneer, Donaldson claimed to have seen a white prayer flag atop a bluff in the distance. When a scout was dispatched to investigate, he returned with a square yard of calico fastened along a cross piece atop a large pole. A plug of tobacco was suspended on either side of the perpendicular cross, which Donaldson interpreted as “an offering to some deity, made doubtless, to secure protection of some kind, and most likely from this expedition.”<br></br>

Although the expedition geologist recorded a “total absence of fossils,” he did mention that large fragments of petrified wood were scattered across the prairie near Cannon Ball River (whose name derives from the perfectly round boulders strewn along either side of its banks). Besides its “large size,” Donaldson praised the “rare beauty and value” of the region’s petrified wood, explaining that choice specimens “weigh at least one thousand pounds.” Upon examination, Winchell, the expedition geologist, “expressed the belief” that a single fossil might be worth hundreds of dollars to a well-endowed museum.<br></br>

Finally, several newspaper journalists reported widespread anxiety about the prospect of reaching Slim Butte in the coming days. Although the Chicago Inter-Ocean claimed that no white man had ever laid eyes on the region, local “Indians tell of beautiful scenery, remarkable caves, and rare minerals there.” According to the expedition's Arikara scout – Goose – Native people especially revered a cave which could only be entered through a hole in the ground. Inside, there were evil spirits and it was “continually filled with the shrieks and wailings of the tormented damned.” On its walls, Goose continued, “are carved great inscriptions in some unknown language, in letters as long as his arm, which even the medicine men of the Sioux have been unable to interpret.”<br></br><a href=""https://scalar.usc.edu/works/in-and-out-of-place/index"" target=""_blank"">Learn more.</a>",Cross-referenced.,,Stereoscopic view of Cannon Ball River by William H.

July seventh was an especially hard day. The men awoke at three and marched from four o’clock in the morning until ten o’clock at night. Conditions were made even more difficult by the high temperatures, as well as the lack of good drinking water (the expedition only came across a few shallow pools of alkaline water). Apparently, the day’s march lasted so long – about eighteen hours in total, covering some thirty miles – because that was how long it took to find a suitable campsite with fresh water. As Aris B. Donaldson complained in the St. Paul Pioneer, it did not help matters that “someone’s blunder” caused the entire train to be misled by one mile, forcing everyone to double back and “countermarch that distance over bad road.” The only excitement came in the form of abundant antelope, as well as a number of “Indian trails” that Theodore Ewert judged to have “been made during the past few days.” Although “no danger is anticipated,” several Native scouts were dispatched to reconnoiter the situation and ascertain whether the expedition was under surveillance.<br></br><a href=""https://scalar.usc.edu/works/in-and-out-of-place/index"" target=""_blank"">Learn more.</a>",Cross-referenced.,,,,https://cawm.lib.uiowa.edu/tiles/{z}/{x}/{y}.png,0.9,geojson/treatyland-1868.geojson,0.1

Mean Temp: 77F<br>
Distance Marched: 19 miles<br></br>All the talk of a Sioux attack had left the men on high alert. So when firing broke out on around three in the morning on the 8th, the men jumped instantly to their arms, eager to meet their first fight of the expedition (all the while “inwardly swearing at the Indians for not waiting 'till day and so unceremoniously disturbing our few hours sleep.”) Their caution, though, proved to be for naught–as it turned out to be nothing more than a few poor antelope who had wandered too close to the camp, and for their wandering paid a dear price. According to Private Ewert, events like these were not only common but exciting for many of the men, who were “always mad when told that no Indians [were] around waiting to attack the camp and that they [could] return to their blankets and finish the broken ‘nap.’ Others, however, wrote wearily of the event. Donaldson scorned the “needly firing of a picket guard whose imagination converted an innocent antelope into a lurking savage.”<br></br> 

The interruptions of the night had little effect on their march, which continued steadily along table land. All of this was much to the excitement of the geologists, who in their report spoke extensively of the day’s findings, including sandstone, siliceous limestone, “beautiful pebbles and stones”, and an abundance of local fossil wood.<br></br>

One of the Native scouts, Goose–who had long boasted of his abilities as a guide–led them in the direction of a timbered oasis, which their native companions referred to as “Pa-ha-che-cha-cha, or ‘Hidden Wood’”. This proved to be a picturesque, meadowed location, and the expedition’s arrival at the previously uncharted spot only proved Goose’s familiarity with the region. Here, they watched the sun set over the tree-laden hills, “as gorgeously beautiful as any that ever glowed on Indian skies.” Illingworth, seeing this, made it a point to stop for a stereoscopic image of the camp from afar. The beauty and shade, however, was only a small solace after a hot and dusty day, through which the men had “suffered and panted… to enjoy this balmy evening and beautiful spot.” The land, rocky and lacking any sort of timber or coal, made starting any sort of fire difficult; Donaldson bitterly complained that not even a tea-kettle could be brought to a boil under their conditions.

Continuing their march on July 9th, the expedition wound their way towards the Grand River through an arid and hilly landscape. Heading westward, they traversed hills “abounding” in colored pebbles. The geological formations of the area made quite an impression on Aris Donaldson, who described passing  “innumerable” buttes whose “rocky pinnacles and ledges were all around us.” The imposing terrain, particularly the area surrounding Wolf Butte, was highlighted by the NY Tribune for its large quantities of petrified wood. Donaldson–the expedition’s botanist– likewise reported on the acres of petrifactions, paying specific attention to the wide variety of colors and sizes. He was impressed, and described how they came across their “finest single specimen” of fossilized wood to date: a massive petrified stump half-buried in the side of a hill.<br></br> 

During the march, the expedition crossed a recently used road connecting the Powder River region and the agencies on the Missouri River. Goose, an Arikara scout, noted that men hunting near the Powder, Yellowstone, and Musselshell Rivers were in the process of returning to the reservations and would shortly “take fresh ponies [and] more ammunition and will then meet us at the Black Hills,” news which Private Theodore Ewert found “very encouraging and gratifying.”<br></br>

Traversing the hills, the day’s route became “serpentine,” and Donaldson stated that it was “hard to trail over a surface so broken into gullies.” Despite the indirect path, they soon began a slow descent towards their goal of the North Fork of the Grand River, entering the plains of a level valley. Private Theodore Ewert noted the lack of vegetation or wood, and the Ludlow Report describes the “scanty growth” of grasses in the region. Despite the sterility of the landscape, Donaldson claims that the expedition’s accompanying cattle herd and cavalry frequently halted to graze. Upon reaching the Grand River, multiple accounts express dissatisfaction with the stream and the alkaline soil. Private Theodore Ewert described it as “small and dirty… grand only in its insignificance.” Here, on a wide tract of land north of the river, they camped for the evening.

The tenth of July brought a long, but fairly routine day of marching along the banks of the Grand River. According to the St. Paul Pioneer, they passed over an arid country of low quality soil, and the expedition’s topographical engineer, William Ludlow, commented that “ grasshoppers were in immense numbers during these two days.” Everyone anticipated finally reaching the sacred caves that Goose, the expedition’s Arikara scout, had spoken about several days prior. Finally, Private Ewert claimed that expedition scouts reported seeing sixty lodges of Native people, numbering about fifteen hundred warriors, only twelve miles from the column. “This brought a little life and excitement among the boys,” Ewert recalled, for the “idea of a brush with our red brother was actually welcome news to a great number, and would have been hailed as quite a relief from the dull monotony of the daily marches.”<br></br><a href=""https://scalar.usc.edu/works/in-and-out-of-place/index"" target=""_blank"">Learn more.</a>",Cross-referenced.,,,https://mikemedhurst.com/cgi-bin/display_item.asp?1624,https://cawm.lib.uiowa.edu/tiles/{z}/{x}/{y}.png,0.9,geojson/treatyland-1868.geojson,0.1

Mean Temp: 79.3F<br>
Distance Marched: 19.7 miles<br></br>After much anticipation, the expedition finally reached the sacred caves that Goose had described. Although Native people called it “The place where the cow killed the man,” Custer decided to christen it “Ludlow’s cave,” in honor of the expedition’s topographical engineer. According to Private Ewert, the original name was to commemorate a young warrior who chased a buffalo cow and two of her calves to the foot of the cliff in which the cave was located. Finding herself trapped, the buffalo cow suddenly turned and gored the young warrior and his horse, tearing “both into shreds.”<br></br>

Most accounts describe the cave itself as rather disappointing. With Goose leading the way, a special detachment of the main column finally located it sometime in the late afternoon. According to the NY Tribune, everyone was taken by surprise – but not in a good way: “No chambers, no grottoes, no crystals, no stalactites, no hieroglyphics, nothing but a hole in the wall.” They were so disappointed that some even accused Goose of being a “swindle.” But not everyone saw things that way, and the NY World reported that, in finding the much-talked about cave, “Goose's character as a guide has again been signally endorsed.”<br></br>

Once inside, soldiers found that a large number of petroglyphs had been carved into its soft, sandstone walls. Theodore Ewert, for example, recalled finding “rude artistic resemblances of trees, plants, animals, insects, implements of war, fowl and fish all promiscuously mixed together, but each separate incision with its own peculiar sign and meaning.” Claiming that all of the “different tribes seem to understand the same style of writing,” he speculated that some of the markings allowed “war parties” visiting the cave at different times to communicate with one another.<br></br>

In a poignant moment, Goose refused to participate in the desecration of a sacred site. While soldiers crowded inside the cave and carved their names as a “memento of their visit” next to ancient petroglyphs on the walls, Goose stood near the entrance in silence. According to the NY World, he “thought he had done sacrilege enough in guiding us to the sacred spot without assisting personally at its profanation.”<br></br>

An account in the Chicago Inter-Ocean provides a further indication that Goose may have regretted leading the expedition to such a sacred site. Upon locating the cave’s entrance, for example, Goose came to a stand-still and, “in his stoical way,” made “an indifferent indication with his hand.” The soldiers immediately leapt from their saddles and dashed for “the mysterious entrance, on the walls of which was spirit-writing and demonography.” Unimpressed, they likened the petroglyphs to childish engravings “on the walls of a country schoolhouse.” In contrast, Goose responded with “superstitious veneration.” “He stood at the entrance a few moments and looked at them silently, then turned away and never came near the place again.”<br></br><a href=""https://scalar.usc.edu/works/in-and-out-of-place/index"" target=""_blank"">Learn more.</a>",Cross-referenced.,media/11July-LudlowCave.png,"Stereoscopic view of the entrance to “Ludlow’s Cave,” taken by Illingworth.",,https://cawm.lib.uiowa.edu/tiles/{z}/{x}/{y}.png,0.9,geojson/treatyland-1868.geojson,0.1

The expedition continued with a march along the Grand River–a difficult one, their paths woven through the hills and ravines littering the river’s forks.  Correspondent J. B. Power, writing to the St. Paul Press, compared the landscape to the famed “Bad Lands” and noted that the wagons had quite a difficult time traversing through the rugged terrain. Aris Donaldson, complaining miserably, wrote that the expedition’s guides–though they did well in supplying them with timber, wood and game–could not be relied on for “their judgment as to practicable wagon routes”. Still, the expedition trudged on, moving slowly under the hot sun. The geologists busied themselves with sandrock and lignite along the way, and though they gave their best effort in their search for fossils, none were found.<br></br> 

The expedition ended their march early, in a spot only a few miles from their previous location. Despite the tough journey, the day did offer one source of grace. The expedition’s detour to the cave on the day prior had left the expedition in need of water. And as they set up camp, the expedition came across “good springs”, with “the best water since leaving ‘Lincoln’.” The find left everyone deeply grateful.

The thirteenth of July led the expedition away from the rough terrain they faced the day before, traveling an easy fifteen miles before they halted their march in the early afternoon. Having long left behind the Grand River and the refreshing spring they enjoyed the previous night, the expedition traveled across dry and alkaline open country dotted with cacti. Aris Donaldson lamented the lack of water, stating that the only sources they could find were “stagnant pools”– an effect which he claimed, combined with the heat and the tall buttes scattered around them, exacerbated the apparent “dreariness” of the landscape. Meanwhile, Winchell investigated the buttes they passed. Noticing that several showed traces of “burnt-out” lignite, he took a section of one and hurriedly detailed it in his geological report. According to the NY Tribune’s correspondent S.J. Barrows, the party begrudging camped among the cacti and sagebrush, joking that “Indiscretions in the use of slippers around camp were dearly paid for.”<br></br>

Despite the unremarkable nature of the day’s march, some excitement arose when Captain McDougall of the Seventh Cavalry reported seeing a “small body of Indians” off the left side of the expedition, possibly monitoring their movements. The party was distant and left soon after being spotted. General Custer, in a later dispatch, stated that the group of twenty or so people was the first “[sign] indicating the recent presence of Indians” the expedition had encountered.<br></br><a href=""https://scalar.usc.edu/works/in-and-out-of-place/index"" target=""_blank"">Learn more.</a>",Cross-referenced.,,,,https://cawm.lib.uiowa.edu/tiles/{z}/{x}/{y}.png,0.9,geojson/treatyland-1868.geojson,0.1

After a grueling march lasting about two weeks and covering nearly two hundred and thirty miles, the expedition reached a picturesque valley with good grass and plenty of wood that was situated along a branch of the Little Missouri River. The New York Tribune described what a “great relief” it was to arrive at this place, and everyone “rejoiced” when Custer “wisely” decided to rest there for a day, including “the mules and the horses.” Private Ewert explained that a rest day was especially welcome because “the rank and file” had been ordered to bring just a single change of under-clothes, meaning that each had been worn without washing for one week. Another factor that may have contributed to Custer's decision was that mineral prospectors believed the small river was likely to yield gold. As soldiers washed their underwear, the miners dug down as far as the bedrock. Although they failed to strike pay dirt, Custer still named the site “Prospect Valley.”<br></br>

In contrast, the expedition's geologists had more luck. About ten miles from the camp in Prospect Valley, George Bird Grinell found a Badlands formation called Castle Butte (on account of its resemblance to a medieval castle) that contained several vertebrate fossils. In addition to turtle bones, Grinell also unearthed a large femur that was badly crushed and flattened during the process of fossilization. An article in the NY Tribune speculated that an “aged mammoth, a great deal older than Methusaleh, among his peers quite as respectable, had laid himself down to a final sleep, and, fortunately for us, had left one leg sticking out of the bed.” Although Grinell worked with great care to exhume the large fossil, which measured about four feet in length and almost one foot in diameter, the “many centuries of enforced seclusion” had left it “too weak to endure its sudden exposure, and a large part of it crumbled to pieces.” Grinell initially assumed it was a Mastodon, “a careful study of similar remains since made, together with the subsequent discovery of more characteristic fossils from what were evidently the same beds, renders it highly probable that it was the femur of a dinosaur.”<br></br>

Smoke signals caused a great deal of excitement in camp as well. A journalist for the NY World claimed he could see signals emanating from behind the expedition’s camp: “three smokes, one considerably to the left of the other two, signaling the line of our march and the fact that there are no more of us coming.” In his official dispatch, Custer also interpreted the smoke signals “as carrying information to the main body of our presence and movements.” While some of Native scouts were certain that Sitting Bull planned to “make a stand at the Hills,” Custer reminded everyone that “I sent pacific messages to all the tribes infesting this region,” it was more likely the smoke signals “may have simply been made to enable the villages to avoid us.” In his diary, Theodore Ewert marveled that “In the art of smoke signals the redman is a perfect master, and his code of signals is nearly as complete as our own at the signal office at Washington. Every member of the camp is expecting a battle within the next few days as war and warpath are about the only two words talked about.”<br></br>

Interestingly, a journalist for the NY World commented that while expedition soldiers busied themselves with debates about how to interpret the meaning of smoke signals, the Arikara scouts were preoccupied by a comet which they had seen for the past several nights. Convinced that it represented a portentous omen, particularly since “the prophets of the Sioux have been unrelentingly preaching a crusade of extermination against the whites,” they warned that “the spirits of the dead are upon the war-path.”<br></br><a href=""https://scalar.usc.edu/works/in-and-out-of-place/index"" target=""_blank"">Learn more.</a>",Cross-referenced.,,,,https://cawm.lib.uiowa.edu/tiles/{z}/{x}/{y}.png,0.9,geojson/treatyland-1868.geojson,0.1

Custer ordered a day of rest on the 15th, which the expedition spent at Prospect Valley camp. The much-needed break offered an opportunity for the expedition to catch up on necessary chores; Private Ewert described a scene of nearly six hundred men scattered along the creek, “scrubbing and splashing their linen in a genuine washwoman style”. The brief pause also gave the men an opportunity to write back home, though here Ewert complained that “the allowance for each company was so limited that only a few could send their letters east.” Ewert himself was only able to send two small, light letters to update his friends back home.<br></br> 

The letters were entrusted to two Arikara messengers, Skunk’s Head and Bull’s Neck. Both were hand-picked by Bloody Knife–and seemingly for good reason. The Chicago Inter-Ocean described one of them as a “an immense raw-feathered fellow, with squirrel fur braid in his hair and breech-clout of bead-embroidered flannel around his loins.” Equipped with “the best revolvers and carbines”, and their ponies well-stocked with ammunition, coffee, and rations, the messengers were well-prepared for any encounters along the way. Instructed to travel only by night, the two were sent off at 8 o’clock that evening to begin their 228-mile trek. The journey was to take four days, provided the Sioux left them alone. Although it would be a long trip, they would not be required to return to the expedition. And given that the two had “squaws and papooses” at Fort Lincoln, the opportunity to return was likely welcome.<br></br>

As a whole, it was a calm day for recuperation and rest. Fred W. Power wrote happily of it in his diary, stating that nothing much happened “except the pleasure of remaining over all day, which was of itself a treat.”<br></br><a href=""https://scalar.usc.edu/works/in-and-out-of-place/index"" target=""_blank"">Learn more.</a>",Cross-referenced.,,,,https://cawm.lib.uiowa.edu/tiles/{z}/{x}/{y}.png,0.9,geojson/treatyland-1868.geojson,0.1

The expedition broke camp early in the morning and spent nearly sixteen hours on the march. Some excitement came in the late morning when several scouts reported seeing small groups of Native people. The special correspondent of the St. Paul Press accompanied Lieutenant Wallace, the commander of the expedition’s Native scouts, to a nearby hill to view the groups after ""one of the braves"" reported a sighting, seeing a few people three miles away. According to the New York Tribune, it appeared that the groups were traveling alongside the expedition– news that caught the interest of commanding officers. Soon, General Custer was informed and issued orders to “take additional precautions against a surprise.” Nothing came of these preparations, however, and the expedition continued uninterrupted into the valley of the Little Missouri.<br></br> 

While the main flank of the expedition moved west towards the valley entrance, an exploring party from the Scientific Corps, led by Colonel Ludlow, made a detour for a nearby ridge of hills. The party, accompanied by cavalry under Lieutenant Hodgson, included professors Winchell and Grinnell, guides Goose and Louis Agard, and the Inter-Ocean and New York Tribune correspondents. Winchell dutifully reported the geological formations they passed, paying particular attention to the “arenaceous, chalky limestone” of the region. Goose and Louis Agard identified a group in the distance as Sioux, which the rest of the party could not see. Barrows stated that Goose’s observations were heeded, as they “had too much respect for his opinion.” Making their way for the Short-Pine Buttes, they ascended a broad tableland “distinctively different” from the previous region. Samuel J. Barrows was impressed by the scene, writing to the New York Tribune that the area contained “more timber than we had seen during the whole extent of our trip.” On the plateau, the party caught a clear sight of the Black Hills for the first time.<br></br>

The hills held more than vegetation, however. Here, sunk in clay, Professor Winchell uncovered fossilized turtle bones, a large ball-and-socket joint, petrified wood, and two large vertebrae with the base of a skull that Professor Grinnell identified as remains characteristic of herbivorous dinosaurs “nearly as large as Hadrosaurus Foulkii.” Grinnell also recounted finding “a few fossiliferous concretions,” possibly new Cretaceous species related to Terebratula and Anchura biangulata. Yet the search of the area remained cursory. Meaning to intercept the main train as they turned southward, the Scientific Corps cut their exploration short. Professor Grinnel disappointedly confided that “little was accomplished” by the excursion.<br></br>

Around three in the afternoon, the exploring party descended from the hills and rejoined the main expedition. They stopped briefly to refuel their horses before continuing their march for the Little Missouri, which they reached around five o’clock. The previous valley was devoid of grass and timber, Aris Donaldson derisively lauding it the “valley of disappointment,” and the banks of the river provided little for their horses and herds to graze upon. After resting for a few minutes to fill their water caskets and restock their supply of timber, General Custer gave the order to continue marching, hoping to find a place suitable for the night. They turned sharply away from the river towards the northwest corner of the Black Hills, where the expedition’s guides indicated they would find the easiest entrances to the Hills. Traveling another nine or so miles, they finally halted in the late evening, “half in sight of the Black Hills”.<br></br><a href=""https://scalar.usc.edu/works/in-and-out-of-place/index"" target=""_blank"">Learn more.</a>",Approximate.,,,,https://cawm.lib.uiowa.edu/tiles/{z}/{x}/{y}.png,0.9,geojson/treatyland-1868.geojson,0.1

As the expedition column marched south towards the Belle Fourche River, the Black Hills finally came within view. “What a glorious moment,” Private Ewert exclaimed as he laid eyes upon the majestic mountains, “black as ink, range upon range, stretching away into the distance and mysterious as ever.” Catching sight of this “supposed New Eldorado” inevitably caused a turn in the conversation towards “filthy lucre.” What if all the rumors about gold turned out to be true? How would they carry their bounty back home? As expedition soldiers talked of emptying their saddle pockets to make room for gold nuggets, they vowed to stake a mineral claim “according to law” and grow rich from the proceeds. None of these dreams ever came to fruition, “yet at the time they gave us much pleasure.”<br></br>

While expedition soldiers dreamed of striking it rich in the Black Hills, journalists made light of the poor and desolate landscape they marched through that day. Aris P. Donaldson, in particular, did not mince words about what a “God forsaken” country it was, insisting that it was “only fit for rattlesnakes and Indians.” Given its arid and infertile soil, which only seemed to support a “scraggly brush plant called by the Indians “Grease weed,” Donaldson encouraged the United States Government “to give the Indians, their assigns, heirs, &c, the country forever.” As if that was not bad enough, this region was “made hateful to our memory by a terrible dust storm, which be-soiled everything in our tents and made life to the occupants utterly miserable,” the New York Tribune reported.<br></br>

The region may have been lacking in fertile soil and lush vegetation, but it offered plenty of fossils. In his official report, the expedition Geologist described entering a dense “net-work of ravines and alternating clay hills.” Barren and heavily eroded, most of the region’s “little eminences” were about 25 to 50 feet high, with numerous “ limy concretions” that turned out to be “filled with fossils” scattered about. George Bird Grinell recalled finding a large quantity of “limestone concretions” most of which were “cracked and broken by exposure to the weather.” However, “when a concretion could be found which had not broken up, the specimens from it were well preserved,” and included numerous species of invertebrates from the “so-called Fort Pierre group.”<br></br><a href=""https://scalar.usc.edu/works/in-and-out-of-place/index"" target=""_blank"">Learn more.</a>",Cross-referenced.,,,,https://cawm.lib.uiowa.edu/tiles/{z}/{x}/{y}.png,0.9,geojson/treatyland-1868.geojson,0.1

A long march lasting nearly twelve hours brought the expedition to a branch of the Belle Fourche river. Captain Ludlow, chief engineer, described passing over “broken country” before reaching a river about 30 to 50 feet wide and four feet deep with a strong current, which cut through a “well-timbered” valley whose soil was strongly impregnated with iron.<br></br> 

Everyone was elated to escape from the heat of the open prairie. “We had learned to appreciate at every halt on the march the shady side of a horse,” the NY Tribune reported, but “the prospect of having a real, live tree–a tree that would not tread on you just as you had dropped to sleep; a tree that did not need to be picketed, and would not move around to feed; a genuine, legitimate tree… –the prospect was more than silence could bear, and we said, ‘Hallelujah!’”<br></br>

But not everyone was equally impressed. A journalist named Fred W. Power wrote that although the expedition geologist “seems to think that the soil generally is good, very good,” he remained skeptical: “the want of rain will in my opinion prevent the country from ever being of any very great benefit to man, or civilized man.” “The noble Red Man of the West may wander over & gain [a] subsistence by hunting,” Power continued, “but certainly never by cultivation.”<br></br>

Finally, as the expedition drew close to the Black Hills, Native people continued to make their presence felt. Power, for example, claimed to pass by an “Indian grave made not over 3 days ago,” while Private Ewert saw plumes of smoke rising up “in large dark masses” off in the distance, “no doubt informing incoming tribes that we had invaded the sanctum and now needed punishing.” Ludlow, the chief engineer, also claimed that the expedition’s Native guides refused to offer guidance about the best route into the Black Hills. “They have hitherto supposed we would skirt the hills without seriously attempting an entrance,” Ludlow concluded.<br></br><a href=""https://scalar.usc.edu/works/in-and-out-of-place/index"" target=""_blank"">Learn more.</a>",Cross-referenced.,,,,https://cawm.lib.uiowa.edu/tiles/{z}/{x}/{y}.png,0.9,geojson/treatyland-1868.geojson,0.1

Heavy rainfall began as early as dawn and did not let up until around 4 p.m., forcing the expedition to remain in camp near the Belle Fourche all day. Looking to salvage the day, Ludlow and his engineering corps set off and conducted an eight to ten-mile reconnaissance with Colonel Hart’s company in tow. The corps’ “ambition”, according to the correspondent for the New York Tribune, had “always [sought] the highest peaks.” The reconnaissance group came across an “old time-worn trail,” which Ludlow “pursued.. sufficiently far” enough to determine that the trail had been made by Capt. Raynolds in 1859 on a trip to the Yellowstone. The expedition had generally followed Raynolds’ path fairly closely; the Bismarck Tribune noted the camp’s proximity to Capt. Raynolds’ old camp, almost exactly fifteen years prior.<br></br>

This small discovery, however, was not enough for Donaldson, who complained that the reconnaissance party “returned to camp late in the night, with no other result than that of being wet, weary and hungry.”

The threat of rain loomed yet again in the morning, but now approaching the base of the Black Hills, the march continued. The expedition left behind Capt. Raynolds’ trail, crossing the Belle Fourche and beginning a meandering ascent out of the valley. General Custer, searching for a proper route to lead the expedition, remarked that they had begun “skirmishing with the Black Hills.” The careful, slow progress was impeded by the rainfall the day before, as Theodore Ewert complained that until ten in the morning, the ground was still soggy, the wet soil slowing down the wagons considerably. This tedium ended when they reached the summit of the opposite hills, entering a vast, rolling prairie. Around two o’clock, their trail through this grassland descended southward into a gorgeous valley. The expedition marveled at the lush vegetation, high grasses, ""delightful"" temperature, and stark contrast with their previous marches. Thoroughly pleased by the region, Ludlow was thankful to leave behind the “hot, dry, burned-up landscape north of the Belle Fourche.” Likewise, Aris Donaldson praised the rich soil and lack of cacti or brush weeds he had become accustomed to. Meanwhile, after asking his men their opinion as they entered the valley, Theodore Ewert relayed that they thought it was “the finest scene they had ever looked upon.” Illingworth, the expedition's photographer, took a stereoscopic print of the mountain range that Ewert excitedly hoped would “give the people in the east an opportunity of also enjoying a look at the noted Black Hills.” Still working their way towards the interior of the mountains, they passed over narrow ridges and grassy parks until they came to rest by a stream near a range of sandstone hills.<br></br><a href=""https://scalar.usc.edu/works/in-and-out-of-place/index"" target=""_blank"">Learn more.</a>",Based on Capt.

The expedition’s march through the Red Water Valley was full of excitement. Reports and personal accounts alike contain striking descriptions of the Valley’s brick-red soil and red streams, complemented with white bands of gypsum and bright green grass. Donaldson’s sense of awe is evident in his account, calling the valley an “immense meadow” with “enough gypsum… to fertilize every acre of land in the United States.”<br></br>

Expedition scientists took care to document the land’s natural richness, their reports detailing veins of iron ore, gypsum, magnesia, carbonized lime, and Jurassic-era Red Beds in the sandstone. A large number of invertebrate fossils were also discovered here, including several Belemnites whose characteristics indicated the expedition was passing through rocks from the Jurassic period.<br></br>

Rich as the valley was, traversing its ravines and cuts proved challenging. Private Ewert recalled that “hills arose like walls,” forcing them to come to an abrupt halt. Several scouts were sent out ahead to find another path through, only to “[return] and [report] that none could be found where the train could possibly get along.” Custer, however, was not to be stopped; he mounted “his little pony, Dandy,” and set off on his own to find a feasible route for the group. Less than an hour later, he returned, and guided the party back to more agreeable land. Their journey descended towards a small creek, where they set up camp for the night. This creek, too, was pleasant; and the mountain spring water, “delightful from its clearness and coldness,” was said to be “impregnated by the gypsum-veins… endowed with highly medicinal properties.” Here, Custer, took time to show off several “specimens and curiosities,” including petrified wood, prairie owls, a hawk, a porcupine, horned toads and three live rattlesnakes.<br></br>

The day ended with the first death of the expedition. Private John Cuningham of Company H passed on the night of the 21st, succumbing to dysentery and illness. He was described by the Bismarck Tribune as a good soldier, though nothing was known of his relatives.<br></br><a href=""https://scalar.usc.edu/works/in-and-out-of-place/index"" target=""_blank"">Learn more.</a>",Cross-referenced.,,,,https://cawm.lib.uiowa.edu/tiles/{z}/{x}/{y}.png,0.9,geojson/treatyland-1868.geojson,0.1

According to Ludlow’s official map, the 22nd of July brought the expedition within just a few miles of the Sundance Hills in what is now Northeastern Wyoming. Curiously, however, neither Ludlow nor anyone else mentioned passing this important landmark, where Lakotan and Cheyenne people have long practiced their sacred ceremonies, in their official accounts.<br></br>

That morning also saw the second death of the expedition. A feud erupted between two expedition soldiers– Joseph Turner and William Roller–before leaving camp.  Apparently, long-simmering animosity boiled over into a “quarrel” that led to an “impromptu duel.” In the Chicago Inter-Ocean, Curtis wrote that “both had murder in their minds and arms in their hands—only Turner was a little the slower.” When the latter finally died in an ambulance later that afternoon, Roller was placed under arrest to await trial once the expedition had run its course.<br></br>

Continuing to march up the Red Water Valley, the expedition marveled at the surrounding landscape. Ludlow described a “mass” of gypsum, “crystallized and shining beautifully,” which was marked by deep cuts because “the Indians, for generations, have, in passing, split off pieces for ornaments.” In addition, the expedition also came across other “Indian signs,” including a well-marked trail leading southeast towards the Red Cloud and Spotted Tail agencies.<br></br> 

That night, after the expedition reached its camp four miles east of Inyan Kara, a funeral was held for John Cunningham and Joseph Turner on a nearby knoll. The whole company attended, and the band played a sorrowful funeral dirge as the two bodies were laid to rest.<br></br><a href=""https://scalar.usc.edu/works/in-and-out-of-place/index"" target=""_blank"">Learn more.</a>",Cross-referenced.,,,,https://cawm.lib.uiowa.edu/tiles/{z}/{x}/{y}.png,0.9,geojson/treatyland-1868.geojson,0.1

Most of the expedition spent July 23rd in camp, but it was hardly a quiet day. Determined to ascend Inyan Kara, General Custer formed a small party (among whom were Bear’s Ears, Agard, Colonel Ludlow, and the scientific corps) and left camp around 7 o’clock in the morning. Inyan Kara was said to be the highest in the western range of the Black Hills; a “prominent landmark” with a height of 6,600 feet. It was a rough trip – even with the guidance of Bear’s Ears and Agard, the group struggled to maneuver their wagons and horses through steep hills and ridges. But difficult (“and even dangerous,” Donaldson noted) as it was, the group eventually made it to the summit, where the group carved “74. CUSTER” into the stone, thus marking their presence in this sacred site.<br></br>

Inyan Kara was beautiful, wooded in pine and aspen with abundant berries. It featured a horseshoe-shaped rim, with an elevated peak in the center and a small spring flowing outwards. From atop Inyan Kara, Custer and Ludlow hoped to scope out a path to the interior of the Black Hills, which remained elusive even to their Native guides. But their plans were frustrated by Lakotan warriors, who set fire to the surrounding prairies. In his official report, Ludlow described that despite waiting for two hours, “the smoke [only grew] denser.” Accepting the poor visibility was unlikely to improve, the small group of explorers turned around and headed back to camp. Custer was clearly disappointed by their lack of success, noting only that “The day was not favorable for obtaining distant views…”<br></br>

Back in the camp, expedition soldiers were on high alert after a few men claimed to have seen their enemy in the near distance. Upon investigation, however, their reports were discredited. Private Ewert reasoned that these soldiers were “anxious to create a sensation in the camp.” Similarly, while Fred W. Power claimed to have seen physical traces of “several hundred Indians,” the nature of their trail suggested that they were heading south-west towards Laramie.<br></br><a href=""https://scalar.usc.edu/works/in-and-out-of-place/index"" target=""_blank"">Learn more.</a>",Cross-referenced.,,"The photographer’s shadow in the foreground with Inyan Kara (stone creator) in the background, by William H.

After leaving Inyan Kara, the expedition column traveled east and ascended a slope of white Carboniferous limestone, where they reached a beautiful valley full of lush vegetation. Abundant with wildflowers in full bloom, Custer decided to name their camp “Floral Valley.” He did so in spite of the fact that Winchell, the expedition geologist, recorded a pre-existing Lakotan place-name, Minnelusa (Running Water) Valley, on account of the clear and rapid stream that flowed through it.<br></br>

Fred Power, writing in the St. Paul Press, corroborated the Valley’s signal importance among Lakotan people. In addition to finding lodge poles, a fresh trail, and other evidence of their frequent presence in the region, he also recorded a Native legend about the water that flowed through its center: “Its source is in a beautiful cave, supplied with all of the luxuries of life, both artificial and natural, fruits of all kinds from every clime, wine the finest, foreign and domestic, on every hand fountains of champagne, walls of purest gold and floors of pearl.” In his diary, Power added that while this “cave has not yet been seen, the Genl. intends starting for it in a few days.” On its other end, the stream “is swallowed by a snake of immense size” who “remains under ground in another cave.”<br></br>

Expedition soldiers were overcome with joy at the sight of the valley’s abundant wildflowers. According to the Bismark Tribune, they included “geraniums, asters, the gorgeous lily, the modest daisy, the retiring violet,” which grew alongside of “the coarse gaudy sunflower.” Hence, the Tribune’s journalist remarked, it was “no wonder” the “untutored savage” guards this “ paradise” with “jealous care.” An army scout named Luther North heartily agreed, stating that he had never “seen such a profuse display of flowers,” prompting him to reflect on what a strange sight it was “to glance back on the advancing column of cavalry and behold the men with beautiful bouquets in their hands, while the headgear of the horses were decorated with wreaths of flowers fit to crown a queen of May.”<br></br>

For his part, Private Ewert was equally awed by Valley’s lush and verdant plant-life, which also included strawberries, blueberries, and gooseberries, all of which “abounded plentifully and were really a welcome addition to, or a change from, the coarse army fare.” Still, he hastened to add that “Farmers have no business in the Black Hills,” for its “valleys, even of productive soil, are so narrow that it would require a length of ten miles in order to gain sufficient acres to make a farm.”

Marching southwest through Minnelusa Valley and into the Black Hills, expedition soldiers and scientists remained utterly enchanted by the natural beauty of their surroundings. “An Eden in the clouds,” Samuel Barrows exclaimed in the NY Tribune, confessing that words could not possibly capture his “pleasure in this lovely scene.” Similarly, Private Ewart could hardly contain himself: “A natural garden! One immense, vast flower bed! A paradise!” he wrote in his diary. Even Ludlow, the matter-of-fact engineer,waxed eloquent about this “beautiful wild country.”<br></br>

Barrows was so enchanted that he even claimed that “greed for gold was forgotten.” Ewert sang a different song. “Up to this day the Black Hills had been voted a failure,” he wrote, but as soon as they entered this wonderful place, “the miners at once pronounced it as their opinion that this stream, being worked properly, would yield gold.” While that did not turn out to be true, expedition scientists nonetheless collected a rich bounty of specimens. The botanist Aris B. Donaldson was especially “enraptured” by the profusion of wildflowers, many of which remained “undescribed by botanists,” including “a lily of rarest beauty.” Assuring readers of the St. Paul Pioneer that “Many bulbs have been secured and will be carried home,” Donaldson also related that Custer himself had collected eight pairs of “magnificent antlers,” which he intended to donate to the Smithsonian museum. Finally, several live sand-hill cranes were also captured. These were added to the expedition’s growing “menagerie,” which also included “hares, prairie dogs, night-hawks, owls, one eagle, and a cage of rattlesnakes.”<br></br>

Not to be outdone, expedition geologists were hard at work collecting fossils and rock samples as well. Judging by several genera of invertebrate fossils that it contained, George Bird Grinnell was certain the gritty, metamorphic limestone which underlay this valley dated back to the Carboniferous age. This gave Winchell license to claim that the expedition had discovered a new geological formation, previously unknown to science, which he chose to “​​designate the Minne-lusa Sandstone, from the Indian name of the valley in which it was discovered.”<br></br><a href=""https://scalar.usc.edu/works/in-and-out-of-place/index"" target=""_blank"">Learn more.</a>",Based on Capt.

July 27th was calm and uneventful, but the previous day’s excitement remained on everyone’s mind. Donaldson was especially eager to find out what happened to Long Bear. Although his fate remained a “mystery,” expedition soldiers did manage to locate his saddle and blanket, all covered in blood, as well as some food and his guncover. Most likely, Long Bear had abandoned anything that might slow him down or impede his escape. Luckily, he succeeded in getting away. Although fifteen soldiers had “scoured the woods,” they could find no trace of his horse nor its rider. “Whatever his misfortune may be,” Donaldson concluded, “it is the result of his own indiscretion and double-dealing.”<br></br>
 
Besides the failed search for Long Bear, not much happened that day. Expedition miners busied themselves panning for gold, but returned to camp empty handed. And two companies of soldiers were ordered to help Ludlow reconnoiter the area by taking numerous altitude measurements. “We are at present in the heart of the unexplored country,” an expedition journalist named Fred Power wrote in his diary, and Custer was determined to “give the world a map” while “our friend Illingworth will furnish the finest of views that the country can afford.” Stereoscopic photographs and adventure stories in newspapers were expected to entice fortune-seekers to the Black Hills, while Ludlow’s topographical map would show them the way to access the region.<br></br><a href=""https://scalar.usc.edu/works/in-and-out-of-place/index"" target=""_blank"">Learn more.</a>",Cross-referenced.,,,,https://cawm.lib.uiowa.edu/tiles/{z}/{x}/{y}.png,0.9,geojson/treatyland-1868.geojson,0.1
