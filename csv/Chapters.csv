Abraham Lincoln,Fort Abraham Lincoln,7/1/1874,7/2/1874,46.76944444,-100.8491667,11,Plain,green,"On the first of July, Custer emerged from his headquarters and issued the order to depart at 8am the next day. This “caused great rejoicing in camp,” especially among the expedition’s “civilian attaches.” Apparently, a new shipment of guns had been slow to arrive, which caused a delay lasting more than one week. Although this was “decidedly irksome,” Custer sought to maintain morale among scientists and others who had joined the expedition “on the invitation of the commanding officer, and without pay from the Government” by hosting frequent soirees at his residence in the camp.<br></br>According to the New York World, the camp was also stirred up by an impassioned protest from Episcopal Bishop Hare and other so-called “friends of the Indians,” who accused the expedition of being in “direct defiance and violation” of the 1868 Treaty of Fort Laramie. Although the New York World dismissed the controversy as mere “rumors” spread by “disappointed filibusters and sensation mongers,” the newspaper nonetheless acknowledged that it would have been “graceful to notify the Indians of our intention.” Similar sentiments were also voiced by Theodore Ewert, an expedition soldier, who complained that by ordering an “invasion of the Black Hills,” the United States “forgot its honor,” its “sacred treaty,” and its “integrity.”<br></br>Around the same time, a group of Eastern Dakota (Santee) scouts joined the expedition at Fort Lincoln. According to the New York World, this occasioned a large “war dance” to celebrate an “alliance of the tribes” among the expedition’s Native scouts.<br></br><a href=""https://scalar.usc.edu/works/in-and-out-of-place/index"" target=""_blank"">Learn more.</a>",,media/1July-FtAbrahamLincoln.png,"Broken glass negative plate showing Ft.

A soldier named Theodore Ewert recalled how troops were lined up in four columns with “guidons” flying in the breeze while a band played ""Garry Owen"" and officers “dashed up and down the column with an air of importance.” Anxiously chattering with one another, the troops looked back and saw the wives of officers and enlisted men waving their handkerchiefs in farwell. Next they let out “three hearty cheers” and began marching southwest along the banks of the Heart River. A cavalry scout named Luther North recalled being surprised by the expedition’s festive mood overall. He wrote in his diary that “this was the first and last expedition that I was ever on in an Indian country that had a band along,” adding that Custer often ordered the musicians to assemble in front of his tent after supper and play for an hour or so.<br></br>The large column of men included ten companies of mounted cavalry, three companies of infantry soldiers, about one hundred Native scouts, and a battery of Gatlin guns followed by approximately one hundred and fifty wagons carrying supplies. As they marched over some fifteen miles of rolling prairie, a reporter for the New York World noted several trails which had been “cut deep and stamped hard” by “the extinct buffalo,” whose “bones are everywhere to be found … in little bleached piles.” In addition, the expedition naturalist George Bird Grinell reported the discovery of several invertebrate fossils embedded in “yellowish sandstone” on top of a “lofty bute.”<br></br>By all accounts, it was a hard day’s march that lasted over twelve hours in total. Several soldiers passed out from heat exhaustion, and crossing the Heart River proved almost impossible with the heavy wagons and large Gatling guns. According to a correspondent for the Chicago Inter-Ocean, there was also a great deal of anxiety caused by “startling rumors” about an imminent attack from Lakotan warriors who had gathered under Sitting Bull’s leadership to prevent Custer’s men from entering the Black Hills.<br></br><a href=""https://scalar.usc.edu/works/in-and-out-of-place/index"" target=""_blank"">Learn more.</a>",Cross-referenced.,media/2July-BuckCreek.png,"Column of Cavalry, Artillery, and Wagons making up the 1874 Black Hills Expedition, photographed by William H.

Distance Marched: 14.1 miles<br></br>July 3rd brought another difficult day’s march under the hot sun. According to the St. Paul Pioneer, the temperature reached as high as 101 degrees Fahrenheit. Intense beams of sunlight scorched the earth and made stones so hot they “literally blister the hands.” The day’s march was made all the more strenuous by the region’s unforgiving landscape. In his official report, the geologist Newton H. Winchell described a “broken country” of fairly high altitude underlain by sandstone and strewn over with “foreign boulders.” Other accounts paint a similar picture. In his private diary, a soldier named Theodore Ewert complained about the scarcity of freshwater and lack of tree cover, claiming that soldiers were “compelled” to carry firewood over a distance of more than two miles back to the camp.<br></br>In spite of the harsh climate and difficult terrain, Custer insisted on making the military band put on a show. A correspondent for the Bismarck Tribune wondered who the intended audience of this imposing display might have been. Although “no Indians have yet been seen,” he remarked, the sight of over one thousand soldiers and several hundred horses marching in step to the music “presents a scene decidedly enlivening, and which must strike the Indian, even, with wonder and admiration.”<br></br><a href=""https://scalar.usc.edu/works/in-and-out-of-place/index"" target=""_blank"">Learn more.</a>",Approximate.,,,,https://cawm.lib.uiowa.edu/tiles/{z}/{x}/{y}.png,0.9,,

The fourth of July passed without fanfare or celebration. Indeed, it was a “Fourth by no means glorious,” the New York World lamented; characterized by extreme heat, no shade, and gusts of “alkaline dust” that “made our thirst intolerable, eyes sore, and faces blistered despite veils.” With the benefit of hindsight, however, one wonders if complaints such as these may have been a self-aggrandizing ploy to sell newspapers and broadcast the masculine courage, vigor, and stamina of expedition soldiers. Indeed, Aris Donaldson from the St. Paul Pioneer described a rather different scene, stating the expedition passed through a much “better country,” which was “clothed in green by recent and heavy rains,” compared to previous days.<br></br>

Overall, then, not much of note happened that day. With one exception. Private Theodore Ewert recalled crossing a trail that was cut by Custer’s expedition to the Yellowstone River the previous year. This brought back old memories in the 7th Cavalry’s ranks and “gave the boys a topic for discussion which was kept up 'till late in the night.” How would this year’s expedition compare to the last, they wondered? “Would we meet as many, or more, Indians than last year? Would the expedition be as successful as the one of the Yellowstone? How many would return? Who of our command would remain in the Black Hills?”<br></br><a href=""https://scalar.usc.edu/works/in-and-out-of-place/index"" target=""_blank"">Learn more.</a>",Approximate.,,,,https://cawm.lib.uiowa.edu/tiles/{z}/{x}/{y}.png,0.9,,

If the previous day had been uneventful, the fifth of July was even more tedious and routine. The only excitement consisted of two unfortunate accidents. First, there was a teamster who fell from his seat and broke both of his legs when the wheels of his wagon passed over them. Second, a rattlesnake bit a horse at its fetlock joint just above the hoof. The poor animal began dripping with sweat almost immediately and trembled so much that it nearly fell to the ground. Had it not been for the quick intervention of a veterinary doctor, the horse would have almost certainly died.<br></br>

While it may have been lacking excitement, the day was pleasant for everyone else. According to the St. Paul Pioneer, the expedition passed through as “rich and well-grassed prairie as the very best in any of the States.” Survey geologist Newton Winchell agreed, describing the “country passed through” as “the finest yet seen.” In addition to featuring “a few oaks, and good grass,” it also had “a flowing stream of clear water” that an Arikara scout named Goose called “Where the Bear Stays in Winter.”<br></br><a href=""https://scalar.usc.edu/works/in-and-out-of-place/index"" target=""_blank"">Learn more.</a>",Approximate.,,"Portrait of the Arikara Scout, Goose, taken by David Barry in 1886.",,https://cawm.lib.uiowa.edu/tiles/{z}/{x}/{y}.png,0.9,,
6 JULY 1874: Cannon Ball River,Cannon Ball River,7/6/1874,7/6/1874,46.33111111,-101.7952778,11,Plain,green,"March: 4:50am to 10am<br>
Mean Temp: 78.4F<br>
Distance Marched: 12.9 miles<br></br>As they had for the past several days, members of the expedition woke up in the predawn to escape from the heat and complete the day’s march before noon. Several made note of the fine country through which they passed, which was covered by “good grass” and irrigated by several small rivers and streams. It was so fertile, in fact, that Private Ewert was certain that it “will undoubtedly be settled in course of time.”<br></br>

An antelope sighting led to terrible excitement when a large number of mounted soldiers began giving chase and firing with wanton abandon. As Aris Donaldson wrote in the St. Paul Pioneer, “a great deal of wild shooting was done and a great deal of Uncle Sam's ammunition was wasted.” When soldiers in charge of a Gatlin gun abandoned their post, their work-horses spooked and took off for the prairie, accidentally pulling the large-caliber guns and discharging them in every direction at great risk to the entire company. As punishment, several mounted soldiers were forced to continue marching on foot, and Custer issued an order that forbade anyone from firing their gun within five hundred yards of the company’s flank.<br></br>

In addition to fertile land and abundant game, several members of the expedition also recorded encounters with the region’s native inhabitants. Ewert, for example, claimed to have met “a party of Sioux Indians” who “were eager in their protestations of peace.” He refused to believe they were just hunting on account of the fact that “none of their squaws were with them, and it is well known that without their ‘fair sex’ to do the drudgery the Sioux Indians hunt no game.” Instead, he was convinced the small party had been “posted here as a ‘corps of observation’ on the movements of our expedition.” But “as orders had been issued for us to act simply on the defensive, we did not disturb them.”<br></br>

Writing in the St. Paul Pioneer, Donaldson claimed to have seen a white prayer flag atop a bluff in the distance. When a scout was dispatched to investigate, he returned with a square yard of calico fastened along a cross piece atop a large pole. A plug of tobacco was suspended on either side of the perpendicular cross, which Donaldson interpreted as “an offering to some deity, made doubtless, to secure protection of some kind, and most likely from this expedition.”<br></br>

Although the expedition geologist recorded a “total absence of fossils,” he did mention that large fragments of petrified wood were scattered across the prairie near Cannon Ball River (whose name derives from the perfectly round boulders strewn along either side of its banks). Besides its “large size,” Donaldson praised the “rare beauty and value” of the region’s petrified wood, explaining that choice specimens “weigh at least one thousand pounds.” Upon examination, Winchell, the expedition geologist, “expressed the belief” that a single fossil might be worth hundreds of dollars to a well-endowed museum.<br></br>

Finally, several newspaper journalists reported widespread anxiety about the prospect of reaching Slim Butte in the coming days. Although the Chicago Inter-Ocean claimed that no white man had ever laid eyes on the region, local “Indians tell of beautiful scenery, remarkable caves, and rare minerals there.” According to the expedition's Arikara scout – Goose – Native people especially revered a cave which could only be entered through a hole in the ground. Inside, there were evil spirits and it was “continually filled with the shrieks and wailings of the tormented damned.” On its walls, Goose continued, “are carved great inscriptions in some unknown language, in letters as long as his arm, which even the medicine men of the Sioux have been unable to interpret.”<br></br><a href=""https://scalar.usc.edu/works/in-and-out-of-place/index"" target=""_blank"">Learn more.</a>",Cross-referenced.,,Stereoscopic view of Cannon Ball River by William H.

July seventh was an especially hard day. The men awoke at three and marched from four o’clock in the morning until ten o’clock at night. Conditions were made even more difficult by the high temperatures, as well as the lack of good drinking water (the expedition only came across a few shallow pools of alkaline water). Apparently, the day’s march lasted so long – about eighteen hours in total, covering some thirty miles – because that was how long it took to find a suitable campsite with fresh water. As Aris B. Donaldson complained in the St. Paul Pioneer, it did not help matters that “someone’s blunder” caused the entire train to be misled by one mile, forcing everyone to double back and “countermarch that distance over bad road.” The only excitement came in the form of abundant antelope, as well as a number of “Indian trails” that Theodore Ewert judged to have “been made during the past few days.” Although “no danger is anticipated,” several Native scouts were dispatched to reconnoiter the situation and ascertain whether the expedition was under surveillance.<br></br><a href=""https://scalar.usc.edu/works/in-and-out-of-place/index"" target=""_blank"">Learn more.</a>",Cross-referenced.,,,,https://cawm.lib.uiowa.edu/tiles/{z}/{x}/{y}.png,0.9,,

Mean Temp: 77F<br>
Distance Marched: 19 miles<br></br>All the talk of a Sioux attack had left the men on high alert. So when firing broke out on around three in the morning on the 8th, the men jumped instantly to their arms, eager to meet their first fight of the expedition (all the while “inwardly swearing at the Indians for not waiting 'till day and so unceremoniously disturbing our few hours sleep.”) Their caution, though, proved to be for naught–as it turned out to be nothing more than a few poor antelope who had wandered too close to the camp, and for their wandering paid a dear price. According to Private Ewert, events like these were not only common but exciting for many of the men, who were “always mad when told that no Indians [were] around waiting to attack the camp and that they [could] return to their blankets and finish the broken ‘nap.’ Others, however, wrote wearily of the event. Donaldson scorned the “needly firing of a picket guard whose imagination converted an innocent antelope into a lurking savage.”<br></br> 

The interruptions of the night had little effect on their march, which continued steadily along table land. All of this was much to the excitement of the geologists, who in their report spoke extensively of the day’s findings, including sandstone, siliceous limestone, “beautiful pebbles and stones”, and an abundance of local fossil wood.<br></br>

One of the Native scouts, Goose–who had long boasted of his abilities as a guide–led them in the direction of a timbered oasis, which their native companions referred to as “Pa-ha-che-cha-cha, or ‘Hidden Wood’”. This proved to be a picturesque, meadowed location, and the expedition’s arrival at the previously uncharted spot only proved Goose’s familiarity with the region. Here, they watched the sun set over the tree-laden hills, “as gorgeously beautiful as any that ever glowed on Indian skies.” Illingworth, seeing this, made it a point to stop for a stereoscopic image of the camp from afar. The beauty and shade, however, was only a small solace after a hot and dusty day, through which the men had “suffered and panted… to enjoy this balmy evening and beautiful spot.” The land, rocky and lacking any sort of timber or coal, made starting any sort of fire difficult; Donaldson bitterly complained that not even a tea-kettle could be brought to a boil under their conditions.

Continuing their march on July 9th, the expedition wound their way towards the Grand River through an arid and hilly landscape. Heading westward, they traversed hills “abounding” in colored pebbles. The geological formations of the area made quite an impression on Aris Donaldson, who described passing  “innumerable” buttes whose “rocky pinnacles and ledges were all around us.” The imposing terrain, particularly the area surrounding Wolf Butte, was highlighted by the NY Tribune for its large quantities of petrified wood. Donaldson–the expedition’s botanist– likewise reported on the acres of petrifactions, paying specific attention to the wide variety of colors and sizes. He was impressed, and described how they came across their “finest single specimen” of fossilized wood to date: a massive petrified stump half-buried in the side of a hill.<br></br> 

During the march, the expedition crossed a recently used road connecting the Powder River region and the agencies on the Missouri River. Goose, an Arikara scout, noted that men hunting near the Powder, Yellowstone, and Musselshell Rivers were in the process of returning to the reservations and would shortly “take fresh ponies [and] more ammunition and will then meet us at the Black Hills,” news which Private Theodore Ewert found “very encouraging and gratifying.”<br></br>

Traversing the hills, the day’s route became “serpentine,” and Donaldson stated that it was “hard to trail over a surface so broken into gullies.” Despite the indirect path, they soon began a slow descent towards their goal of the North Fork of the Grand River, entering the plains of a level valley. Private Theodore Ewert noted the lack of vegetation or wood, and the Ludlow Report describes the “scanty growth” of grasses in the region. Despite the sterility of the landscape, Donaldson claims that the expedition’s accompanying cattle herd and cavalry frequently halted to graze. Upon reaching the Grand River, multiple accounts express dissatisfaction with the stream and the alkaline soil. Private Theodore Ewert described it as “small and dirty… grand only in its insignificance.” Here, on a wide tract of land north of the river, they camped for the evening.

The tenth of July brought a long, but fairly routine day of marching along the banks of the Grand River. According to the St. Paul Pioneer, they passed over an arid country of low quality soil, and the expedition’s topographical engineer, William Ludlow, commented that “ grasshoppers were in immense numbers during these two days.” Everyone anticipated finally reaching the sacred caves that Goose, the expedition’s Arikara scout, had spoken about several days prior. Finally, Private Ewert claimed that expedition scouts reported seeing sixty lodges of Native people, numbering about fifteen hundred warriors, only twelve miles from the column. “This brought a little life and excitement among the boys,” Ewert recalled, for the “idea of a brush with our red brother was actually welcome news to a great number, and would have been hailed as quite a relief from the dull monotony of the daily marches.”<br></br><a href=""https://scalar.usc.edu/works/in-and-out-of-place/index"" target=""_blank"">Learn more.</a>",Cross-referenced.,,,https://mikemedhurst.com/cgi-bin/display_item.asp?1624,https://cawm.lib.uiowa.edu/tiles/{z}/{x}/{y}.png,0.9,,

Mean Temp: 79.3F
Distance Marched: 19.7 miles<br></br>After much anticipation, the expedition finally reached the sacred caves that Goose had described. Although Native people called it “The place where the cow killed the man,” Custer decided to christen it “Ludlow’s cave,” in honor of the expedition’s topographical engineer. According to Private Ewert, the original name was to commemorate a young warrior who chased a buffalo cow and two of her calves to the foot of the cliff in which the cave was located. Finding herself trapped, the buffalo cow suddenly turned and gored the young warrior and his horse, tearing “both into shreds.”<br></br>

Most accounts describe the cave itself as rather disappointing. With Goose leading the way, a special detachment of the main column finally located it sometime in the late afternoon. According to the NY Tribune, everyone was taken by surprise – but not in a good way: “No chambers, no grottoes, no crystals, no stalactites, no hieroglyphics, nothing but a hole in the wall.” They were so disappointed that some even accused Goose of being a “swindle.” But not everyone saw things that way, and the NY World reported that, in finding the much-talked about cave, “Goose's character as a guide has again been signally endorsed.”<br></br>

Once inside, soldiers found that a large number of petroglyphs had been carved into its soft, sandstone walls. Theodore Ewert, for example, recalled finding “rude artistic resemblances of trees, plants, animals, insects, implements of war, fowl and fish all promiscuously mixed together, but each separate incision with its own peculiar sign and meaning.” Claiming that all of the “different tribes seem to understand the same style of writing,” he speculated that some of the markings allowed “war parties” visiting the cave at different times to communicate with one another.<br></br>

In a poignant moment, Goose refused to participate in the desecration of a sacred site. While soldiers crowded inside the cave and carved their names as a “memento of their visit” next to ancient petroglyphs on the walls, Goose stood near the entrance in silence. According to the NY World, he “thought he had done sacrilege enough in guiding us to the sacred spot without assisting personally at its profanation.”<br></br>

An account in the Chicago Inter-Ocean provides a further indication that Goose may have regretted leading the expedition to such a sacred site. Upon locating the cave’s entrance, for example, Goose came to a stand-still and, “in his stoical way,” made “an indifferent indication with his hand.” The soldiers immediately leapt from their saddles and dashed for “the mysterious entrance, on the walls of which was spirit-writing and demonography.” Unimpressed, they likened the petroglyphs to childish engravings “on the walls of a country schoolhouse.” In contrast, Goose responded with “superstitious veneration.” “He stood at the entrance a few moments and looked at them silently, then turned away and never came near the place again.”<br></br><a href=""https://scalar.usc.edu/works/in-and-out-of-place/index"" target=""_blank"">Learn more.</a>",Cross-referenced.,media/10July-LudlowCave.png,"Stereoscopic view of the entrance to “Ludlow’s Cave,” taken by Illingworth.",,https://cawm.lib.uiowa.edu/tiles/{z}/{x}/{y}.png,0.9,,

The expedition continued with a march along the Grand River–a difficult one, their paths woven through the hills and ravines littering the river’s forks.  Correspondent J. B. Power, writing to the St. Paul Press, compared the landscape to the famed “Bad Lands” and noted that the wagons had quite a difficult time traversing through the rugged terrain. Aris Donaldson, complaining miserably, wrote that the expedition’s guides–though they did well in supplying them with timber, wood and game–could not be relied on for “their judgment as to practicable wagon routes”. Still, the expedition trudged on, moving slowly under the hot sun. The geologists busied themselves with sandrock and lignite along the way, and though they gave their best effort in their search for fossils, none were found.<br></br> 

The expedition ended their march early, in a spot only a few miles from their previous location. Despite the tough journey, the day did offer one source of grace. The expedition’s detour to the cave on the day prior had left the expedition in need of water. And as they set up camp, the expedition came across “good springs”, with “the best water since leaving ‘Lincoln’.” The find left everyone deeply grateful.

The thirteenth of July led the expedition away from the rough terrain they faced the day before, traveling an easy fifteen miles before they halted their march in the early afternoon. Having long left behind the Grand River and the refreshing spring they enjoyed the previous night, the expedition traveled across dry and alkaline open country dotted with cacti. Aris Donaldson lamented the lack of water, stating that the only sources they could find were “stagnant pools”– an effect which he claimed, combined with the heat and the tall buttes scattered around them, exacerbated the apparent “dreariness” of the landscape. Meanwhile, Winchell investigated the buttes they passed. Noticing that several showed traces of “burnt-out” lignite, he took a section of one and hurriedly detailed it in his geological report. According to the NY Tribune’s correspondent S.J. Barrows, the party begrudging camped among the cacti and sagebrush, joking that “Indiscretions in the use of slippers around camp were dearly paid for.”<br></br>

Despite the unremarkable nature of the day’s march, some excitement arose when Captain McDougall of the Seventh Cavalry reported seeing a “small body of Indians” off the left side of the expedition, possibly monitoring their movements. The party was distant and left soon after being spotted. General Custer, in a later dispatch, stated that the group of twenty or so people was the first “[sign] indicating the recent presence of Indians” the expedition had encountered.<br></br><a href=""https://scalar.usc.edu/works/in-and-out-of-place/index"" target=""_blank"">Learn more.</a>",Cross-referenced.,,,,https://cawm.lib.uiowa.edu/tiles/{z}/{x}/{y}.png,0.9,,

After a grueling march lasting about two weeks and covering nearly two hundred and thirty miles, the expedition reached a picturesque valley with good grass and plenty of wood that was situated along a branch of the Little Missouri River. The New York Tribune described what a “great relief” it was to arrive at this place, and everyone “rejoiced” when Custer “wisely” decided to rest there for a day, including “the mules and the horses.” Private Ewert explained that a rest day was especially welcome because “the rank and file” had been ordered to bring just a single change of under-clothes, meaning that each had been worn without washing for one week. Another factor that may have contributed to Custer's decision was that mineral prospectors believed the small river was likely to yield gold. As soldiers washed their underwear, the miners dug down as far as the bedrock. Although they failed to strike pay dirt, Custer still named the site “Prospect Valley.”<br></br>

In contrast, the expedition's geologists had more luck. About ten miles from the camp in Prospect Valley, George Bird Grinell found a Badlands formation called Castle Butte (on account of its resemblance to a medieval castle) that contained several vertebrate fossils. In addition to turtle bones, Grinell also unearthed a large femur that was badly crushed and flattened during the process of fossilization. An article in the NY Tribune speculated that an “aged mammoth, a great deal older than Methusaleh, among his peers quite as respectable, had laid himself down to a final sleep, and, fortunately for us, had left one leg sticking out of the bed.” Although Grinell worked with great care to exhume the large fossil, which measured about four feet in length and almost one foot in diameter, the “many centuries of enforced seclusion” had left it “too weak to endure its sudden exposure, and a large part of it crumbled to pieces.” Grinell initially assumed it was a Mastodon, “a careful study of similar remains since made, together with the subsequent discovery of more characteristic fossils from what were evidently the same beds, renders it highly probable that it was the femur of a dinosaur.”<br></br>

Smoke signals caused a great deal of excitement in camp as well. A journalist for the NY World claimed he could see signals emanating from behind the expedition’s camp: “three smokes, one considerably to the left of the other two, signaling the line of our march and the fact that there are no more of us coming.” In his official dispatch, Custer also interpreted the smoke signals “as carrying information to the main body of our presence and movements.” While some of Native scouts were certain that Sitting Bull planned to “make a stand at the Hills,” Custer reminded everyone that “I sent pacific messages to all the tribes infesting this region,” it was more likely the smoke signals “may have simply been made to enable the villages to avoid us.” In his diary, Theodore Ewert marveled that “In the art of smoke signals the redman is a perfect master, and his code of signals is nearly as complete as our own at the signal office at Washington. Every member of the camp is expecting a battle within the next few days as war and warpath are about the only two words talked about.”<br></br>

Interestingly, a journalist for the NY World commented that while expedition soldiers busied themselves with debates about how to interpret the meaning of smoke signals, the Arikara scouts were preoccupied by a comet which they had seen for the past several nights. Convinced that it represented a portentous omen, particularly since “the prophets of the Sioux have been unrelentingly preaching a crusade of extermination against the whites,” they warned that “the spirits of the dead are upon the war-path.”<br></br><a href=""https://scalar.usc.edu/works/in-and-out-of-place/index"" target=""_blank"">Learn more.</a>",Cross-referenced.,,,,https://cawm.lib.uiowa.edu/tiles/{z}/{x}/{y}.png,0.9,,
15 JULY 1874: Prospect Valley Camp,Prospect Valley Camp,7/14/1874,7/15/1874,45.48222222,-103.7902778,11,Hidden,green,"March: N/A<br>

Custer ordered a day of rest on the 15th, which the expedition spent at Prospect Valley camp. The much-needed break offered an opportunity for the expedition to catch up on necessary chores; Private Ewert described a scene of nearly six hundred men scattered along the creek, “scrubbing and splashing their linen in a genuine washwoman style”. The brief pause also gave the men an opportunity to write back home, though here Ewert complained that “the allowance for each company was so limited that only a few could send their letters east.” Ewert himself was only able to send two small, light letters to update his friends back home.<br></br> 

The letters were entrusted to two Arikara messengers, Skunk’s Head and Bull’s Neck. Both were hand-picked by Bloody Knife–and seemingly for good reason. The Chicago Inter-Ocean described one of them as a “an immense raw-feathered fellow, with squirrel fur braid in his hair and breech-clout of bead-embroidered flannel around his loins.” Equipped with “the best revolvers and carbines”, and their ponies well-stocked with ammunition, coffee, and rations, the messengers were well-prepared for any encounters along the way. Instructed to travel only by night, the two were sent off at 8 o’clock that evening to begin their 228-mile trek. The journey was to take four days, provided the Sioux left them alone. Although it would be a long trip, they would not be required to return to the expedition. And given that the two had “squaws and papooses” at Fort Lincoln, the opportunity to return was likely welcome.<br></br>

As a whole, it was a calm day for recuperation and rest. Fred W. Power wrote happily of it in his diary, stating that nothing much happened “except the pleasure of remaining over all day, which was of itself a treat.”<br></br><a href=""https://scalar.usc.edu/works/in-and-out-of-place/index"" target=""_blank"">Learn more.</a>",Cross-referenced.,,,,https://cawm.lib.uiowa.edu/tiles/{z}/{x}/{y}.png,0.9,,
