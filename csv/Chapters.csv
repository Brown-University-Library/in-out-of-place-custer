1 JULY 1874: Ft. Abraham Lincoln,Fort Abraham Lincoln,7/1/1874,7/2/1874,46.76944444,-100.8491667,6,Plain,green,"On the first of July, Custer emerged from his headquarters and issued the order to depart at 8am the next day. This “caused great rejoicing in camp,” especially among the expedition’s “civilian attaches.” Apparently, a new shipment of guns had been slow to arrive, which caused a delay lasting more than one week. To maintain morale among scientists and others who had joined the expedition “on the invitation of the commanding officer, and without pay from the Government,” Custer hosted frequent soirees at his residence in the camp.<br></br>

According to the New York World, the camp was also stirred up by an impassioned protest from Episcopal Bishop Hare and other so-called “friends of the Indians,” who accused the expedition of being in “direct defiance and violation” of the 1868 Treaty of Fort Laramie. Although the New York World dismissed the controversy as mere “rumors” spread by “disappointed filibusters and sensation mongers,” the newspaper nonetheless acknowledged that it would have been “graceful to notify the Indians of our intention.” Similar sentiments were voiced by Private Theodore Ewert as well, who complained that by ordering an “invasion of the Black Hills,” the United States “forgot its honor,” its “sacred treaty,” and its “integrity.”<br></br>

Around the same time, a group of Eastern Dakota (Santee) scouts joined the expedition at Fort Lincoln. According to the New York World, this occasioned a large “dance” to cement and celebrate the “alliance” among the expedition’s Native scouts, which also included a number of Arikara warriors.<br></br>",,media/1July-FtAbrahamLincoln.png,"Broken glass negative plate showing Ft.

<br></br>At 8am sharp, the expedition left Fort Lincoln under great fanfare. Private Ewert recalled that troops were lined up in four columns with “guidons” flying in the breeze while a band played ""Garry Owen"" and officers “dashed up and down the column with an air of importance.” Anxiously chattering with one another, the troops looked back and saw the wives of officers and enlisted men waving their handkerchiefs in farwell. They let out “three hearty cheers” and began marching southwest along the banks of the Heart River. A cavalry scout named Luther North recalled being surprised by the expedition’s festive mood overall. He wrote in his diary that “this was the first and last expedition that I was ever on in an Indian country that had a band along,” adding that Custer often ordered the musicians to assemble in front of his tent after supper and play for an hour or so.<br></br>

The large column of men included ten companies of mounted cavalry, three companies of infantry soldiers, about one hundred Native scouts, and a battery of Gatlin guns followed by approximately one hundred and fifty wagons carrying supplies. As they marched over some fifteen miles of rolling prairie, a reporter for the New York World noted several trails which had been “cut deep and stamped hard” by “the extinct buffalo,” whose “bones are everywhere to be found … in little bleached piles.” In addition, the expedition naturalist George Bird Grinell found several invertebrate fossils embedded in “yellowish sandstone” on top of a “lofty bute.”<br></br>

The first day’s march lasted over twelve hours, and several soldiers passed out from heat exhaustion. According to a correspondent for the Chicago Inter-Ocean, there was also a great deal of anxiety caused by “startling rumors” about an imminent attack from Lakotan warriors who had gathered under Sitting Bull’s leadership to prevent Custer’s men from entering the Black Hills.",Cross-referenced.,media/2July-BuckCreek.png,"Column of Cavalry, Artillery, and Wagons making up the 1874 Black Hills Expedition, photographed by William H.

July 3rd brought another difficult day’s march under the hot sun. According to the St. Paul Pioneer, the temperature reached as high as 101 degrees Fahrenheit. Intense beams of sunlight scorched the earth and made stones so hot they “literally blister the hands.” The day was made all the more strenuous by the region’s unforgiving landscape. The geologist Newton H. Winchell described a “broken country” of fairly high altitude underlain by sandstone and strewn over with “foreign boulders.” Other accounts paint a similar picture. In his diary, Private Ewert complained about the scarcity of fresh water and lack of tree cover, claiming that soldiers were “compelled” to carry firewood on horseback for more than two miles back to the camp.<br></br>

In spite of the harsh climate and difficult terrain, Custer insisted on making the military band put on a show. A correspondent for the Bismarck Tribune wondered who the intended audience of this imposing display might have been. Although “no Indians have yet been seen,” he remarked, the sight of over one thousand soldiers and several hundred horses marching in step to the music “presents a scene decidedly enlivening, and which must strike the Indian, even, with wonder and admiration.”<br></br>",Approximate.,,,,https://cawm.lib.uiowa.edu/tiles/{z}/{x}/{y}.png,0.9,geojson/1868fltcombinedland.geojson,weight:2;color:gray;opacity:.6;fillColor:white;fillOpacity:0

The fourth of July passed without fanfare or celebration. Indeed, it was a “Fourth by no means glorious,” the New York World lamented; characterized by extreme heat, no shade, and gusts of “alkaline dust” that “made our thirst intolerable, eyes sore, and faces blistered despite veils.” With the benefit of hindsight, the hardships that were encountered in the treaty lands also smack of the penchant for celebrating the masculine courage, vigor, and stamina that was required on the so-called “frontier.” Indeed, Aris Donaldson from the St. Paul Pioneer described a rather different scene, stating the expedition passed through a much “better country,” which was “clothed in green by recent and heavy rains,” compared to previous days.<br></br>

Overall, not much of note happened that day. With one exception. Private Ewert recalled crossing a trail that was cut by Custer’s expedition to the Yellowstone River the previous year. This brought back old memories in the 7th Cavalry’s ranks and “gave the boys a topic for discussion which was kept up 'till late in the night.” How would this year’s expedition compare to the last, they wondered? “Would we meet as many, or more, Indians than last year? Would the expedition be as successful as the one of the Yellowstone? How many would return? Who of our command would remain in the Black Hills?",Approximate.,,,,https://cawm.lib.uiowa.edu/tiles/{z}/{x}/{y}.png,0.9,geojson/1868fltcombinedland.geojson,weight:2;color:gray;opacity:.6;fillColor:white;fillOpacity:0

If the previous day had been uneventful, the fifth of July was even more tedious and routine. The only excitement consisted of two unfortunate accidents. First, there was a teamster who fell from his seat and broke both of his legs when the wheels of his wagon passed over them. Second, a rattlesnake bit a horse at its fetlock joint just above the hoof. The poor animal began dripping with sweat almost immediately and trembled so much that it nearly fell to the ground. Had it not been for the quick intervention of a veterinary doctor, the horse would have almost certainly died.<br></br>

While it may have been lacking excitement, the day was pleasant for everyone else. According to the St. Paul Pioneer, the expedition passed through as “rich and well-grassed prairie as the very best in any of the States.” Survey geologist Newton Winchell agreed, describing the “country passed through” as “the finest yet seen.” In addition to featuring “a few oaks, and good grass,” it also had “a flowing stream of clear water” that a Lakotan scout named Goose called “Where the Bear Stays in Winter.”",Approximate.,media/5July-WhereBearWinterCreek.png,"Portrait of the Lakotan Scout, Goose, taken by David Barry in 1886.

<br></br>As they had for the past several days, expedition members arose in the predawn to escape from the heat and complete the day’s march before noon. Several made note of the fine country through which they passed, which was covered by “good grass” and irrigated by several small rivers and streams. It was so fertile that Private Ewert felt certain it “will undoubtedly be settled in course of time.” <br></br>

In addition to fertile land and abundant game, several members of the expedition recorded chance encounters with the region’s Native inhabitants. Private Ewert, for example, claimed to have met “a party of Sioux Indians.” Despite being “eager” in “their protestations of peace,” Ewert refused to believe they were just hunting. Instead, he felt convinced the small party had been “posted here as a ‘corps of observation’ on the movements of our expedition.” But “as orders had been issued for us to act simply on the defensive, we did not disturb them.”<br></br>

Writing in the St. Paul Pioneer, Donaldson claimed to have seen a white prayer flag atop a bluff in the distance. When a scout was dispatched to investigate, he returned with a square yard of calico fastened along a cross piece atop a large pole. A plug of tobacco was suspended on either side of the perpendicular cross, which Donaldson interpreted as “an offering to some deity, made doubtless, to secure protection of some kind, and most likely from this expedition.”<br></br>

Although Winchell, the expedition geologist, recorded a “total absence of fossils,” he did mention that large fragments of petrified wood were scattered across the prairie near Cannon Ball River (whose name derives from the perfectly round boulders strewn along either side of its banks). Besides its “large size,” Donaldson praised the “rare beauty and value” of the region’s petrified wood, explaining that choice specimens “weigh at least one thousand pounds.” Upon examination, Winchell “expressed the belief” that a single fossil might be worth hundreds of dollars to a well-endowed museum.<br></br>

More exciting still, an antelope sighting caused expedition soldiers to begin firing with wanton abandon. As Donaldson wrote in the St. Paul Pioneer, “a great deal of wild shooting was done and a great deal of Uncle Sam's ammunition was wasted.” When soldiers in charge of a Gatlin gun abandoned their post, their horses spooked and took off for the prairie, accidentally causing the large-caliber guns to discharge in every direction at great risk to the entire company. As punishment, several cavalry soldiers were forced to continue marching on foot, and Custer issued an order that forbade anyone from firing their gun within five hundred yards of the company’s flank.<br></br>

Finally, several newspaper journalists reported widespread anxiety about the prospect of reaching Slim Butte in the coming days. According to the Chicago Inter-Ocean, local “Indians tell of beautiful scenery, remarkable caves, and rare minerals there.” The expedition's Lakotan scout – Goose – explained that Native people especially revered a cave which could only be entered through a hole in the ground. Inside, there were evil spirits and it was “continually filled with the shrieks and wailings of the tormented damned.” On its walls, Goose continued, “are carved great inscriptions in some unknown language, in letters as long as his arm, which even the medicine men of the Sioux have been unable to interpret.”",Cross-referenced.,media/6July-CannonBallRiver.png,Photograph of Cannon Ball River by William H.

Expedition members awoke at three and marched from four o’clock in the morning until ten o’clock at night on July 7th. Conditions were made even more difficult by the heat, as well as the lack of good drinking water. Apparently, the day’s march lasted so long – about eighteen hours in total, covering some thirty miles – because that was how long it took to find a suitable campsite with fresh water. As Donaldson complained in the St. Paul Pioneer, it did not help matters that “someone’s blunder” caused the entire train to be misled by one mile, forcing everyone to double back and “countermarch that distance over bad road.” The only excitement came in the form of abundant antelope, as well as a number of “Indian trails” that Private Ewert judged to have “been made during the past few days.” Although “no danger is anticipated,” several Native scouts were dispatched to reconnoiter the situation and ascertain whether the expedition was under surveillance.",Cross-referenced.,,,,https://cawm.lib.uiowa.edu/tiles/{z}/{x}/{y}.png,0.9,geojson/1868fltcombinedland.geojson,weight:2;color:gray;opacity:.6;fillColor:white;fillOpacity:0

<br></br>The previous day’s talk of an imminent attack put expedition soldiers on high alert. When gunshots were heard around three in the morning, they jumped to their arms in eager anticipation of a violent encounter (all the while “inwardly swearing at the Indians for not waiting 'till day and so unceremoniously disturbing our few hours sleep.”) In the end, however, it turned out to be nothing more than a few antelope who paid a dear price for wandering too close to the camp. According to Private Ewert, expedition soldiers were “always mad when told that no Indians [were] around waiting to attack the camp and that they [could] return to their blankets and finish the broken ‘nap.’ Others felt differently, however, and Donaldson scolded the “picket guard whose imagination converted an innocent antelope into a lurking savage.”<br></br> 

The next morning, Goose, a Lakotan scout, led the expedition in the direction of a timbered oasis, which he called “Pa-ha-che-cha-cha, or ‘Hidden Wood.’” This picturesque meadow instilled widespread confidence in Goose’s familiarity with the region. Here, expedition members watched the sun set over the tree-laden hills, “as gorgeously beautiful as any that ever glowed on Indian skies.” Illingworth, seeing this, made it a point to stop for a stereoscopic image of the camp from afar.",Cross-referenced.,media/8July-HiddenwoodCreek.jpg,"Campsite at Hiddenwood Creek, photographed by Wiliam H.

Heading west towards the Grand River through an arid and hilly landscape, the expedition traversed an imposing terrain “abounding” in colored pebbles. The region’s impressive geology made a particular impression on Donaldson, who described “innumerable” buttes topped by “rocky pinnacles and ledges.” He also reported seeing acres of petrified wood, which included a massive stump that constituted “finest single specimen” encountered so far.<br></br>

The expedition also crossed a trail connecting the Powder River region to the agencies on the Missouri River. Goose, a Lakotan scout, noted that men hunting near the Powder, Yellowstone, and Musselshell Rivers were in the process of returning to the agencies and would shortly “take fresh ponies [and] more ammunition and will then meet us at the Black Hills,” which Private Ewert found “very encouraging and gratifying.”",Cross-referenced.,,,,https://cawm.lib.uiowa.edu/tiles/{z}/{x}/{y}.png,0.9,geojson/1868fltcombinedland.geojson,weight:2;color:gray;opacity:.6;fillColor:white;fillOpacity:0

The tenth of July brought a long day of marching along the north fork of the Grand River. According to the St. Paul Pioneer, the expedition passed over an arid country with low quality soil, whereas William Ludlow, the topographical engineer, noted that “grasshoppers were in immense numbers during these two days.” In his diary, Private Ewert reported seeing sixty lodges of Native people, numbering about fifteen hundred warriors, only twelve miles from the column. “This brought a little life and excitement among the boys,” Ewert recalled, for the “idea of a brush with our red brother was actually welcome news to a great number, and would have been hailed as quite a relief from the dull monotony of the daily marches.”",Cross-referenced.,,,,https://cawm.lib.uiowa.edu/tiles/{z}/{x}/{y}.png,0.9,geojson/1868fltcombinedland.geojson,weight:2;color:gray;opacity:.6;fillColor:white;fillOpacity:0

After much anticipation, the expedition finally reached the sacred caves that Goose had described. Although Native people called it “The place where the cow killed the man,” Custer decided to christen it “Ludlow’s cave,” in honor of the expedition’s topographical engineer. According to Private Ewert, the original name commemorates a young warrior who had chased a buffalo cow and two of her calves to the foot of the cliff in which the cave was located. Finding herself trapped, the buffalo cow suddenly turned and gored the young warrior and his horse, tearing “both into shreds.” Others accounts gave a different name, however. The NY World, for example, described it as “The Place Where the Man was Killed by a Bull.” The Chicago Inter-Ocean claimed that Native people simply called it “Wassum,” or “hole in the ground.” This clearly refers to the Lakotan word “Washun,” which literally translates to “hole in the ground” and is often used to describe the den of a fox, beaver, and other burrowing animals.<br></br>

With Goose leading the way, a special detachment of soldiers located the cave sometime in the late afternoon. According to the NY Tribune, expedition soldiers were surprised by what they found – but not in a good way: “No chambers, no grottoes, no crystals, no stalactites, no hieroglyphics, nothing but a hole in the wall.” They were so disappointed, in fact, that some even accused Goose of being a “swindle.” But not everyone agreed, and the NY World reported that, in finding the much-talked about cave, “Goose's character as a guide has again been signally endorsed.” <br></br>

Once inside, soldiers found a large number of petroglyphs, which had been carved into its soft, sandstone walls. Private Ewert, for example, recalled seeing “rude artistic resemblances of trees, plants, animals, insects, implements of war, fowl and fish all promiscuously mixed together, but each separate incision with its own peculiar sign and meaning.” Claiming that all of the “different tribes seem to understand the same style of writing,” he speculated that some of these markings were made by “war parties,” who sought to coordinate their activities with others who visited the cave after them.<br></br>

In a poignant moment, Goose refused to participate in the desecration of a sacred site. While soldiers crowded inside the cave and carved their names as a “memento of their visit” next to ancient petroglyphs, Goose stood near the entrance in silence. According to the NY World, he “thought he had done sacrilege enough in guiding us to the sacred spot without assisting personally at its profanation.”<br></br>

The Chicago Inter-Ocean provides further evidence that Goose felt regret upon leading expedition soldiers to such a sacred site. Upon locating the cave’s entrance, he came to a stand-still and, “in his stoical way,” made “an indifferent indication with his hand.” The soldiers immediately leapt from their saddles and dashed for “the mysterious entrance, on the walls of which was spirit-writing and demonography.” While soldiers likened the petroglyphs to childish engravings “on the walls of a country schoolhouse,” Goose responded with “superstitious veneration.” “He stood at the entrance a few moments and looked at them silently, then turned away and never came near the place again.”",Cross-referenced.,media/11July-LudlowsCave.jpg,"Stereoscopic view of the entrance to “Ludlow’s Cave,” taken by Illingworth.",https://mikemedhurst.com/cgi-bin/display_item.asp?1624,https://cawm.lib.uiowa.edu/tiles/{z}/{x}/{y}.png,0.9,geojson/1868fltcombinedland.geojson,weight:2;color:gray;opacity:.6;fillColor:white;fillOpacity:0

The expedition left the Cave Hills and commenced a difficult march along the Grand River, their path weaving through many hills and ravines. J. B. Power, writing for the St. Paul Press, compared the landscape to the famed “Bad Lands” and noted that it was almost impossible for the wagons to traverse the rugged terrain. For his part, Donaldson complained bitterly about expedition guides whose judgment could not be relied on to find “practicable wagon routes.” Still, they trudged on, moving slowly under the hot sun. The geologists busied themselves with sandrock and lignite, but failed to find any fossils. The day ended early, when expedition soldiers were grateful to find several “good springs” with “the best water since leaving ‘Lincoln.’”",,,,,https://cawm.lib.uiowa.edu/tiles/{z}/{x}/{y}.png,0.9,geojson/1868fltcombinedland.geojson,weight:2;color:gray;opacity:.6;fillColor:white;fillOpacity:0

Having reached better terrain, the expedition easily traversed fifteen miles before making camp in the early afternoon. Traveling across dry and alkaline country dotted with cacti, Donaldson lamented the lack of fresh water. Apparently, they only found a few “stagnant pools,” which greatly exacerbated the “dreariness” of the landscape. Meanwhile, Winchell noticed traces of “burnt-out” lignite as they passed through a series of buttes. According to the NY Tribune, expedition soldiers who begrudgingly camped among the cacti and sagebrush did their best to make light of a bad situation, joking that “Indiscretions in the use of slippers around camp were dearly paid for.”<br></br>

In addition, these days were once again filled with renewed anxiety about encountering the region’s Native inhabitants. Captain McDougall, for example, claimed to see a “small body of Indians” whom he suspected of monitoring their movements, but they left soon after being spotted. General Custer concurred, describing the encounter as the first real indication of the “presence of Indians.” As a result, everyone was on high alert, and expedition soldiers took “great care to prevent surprise or stampede of stock,” although in the end nothing happened.",Cross-referenced.,,,,https://cawm.lib.uiowa.edu/tiles/{z}/{x}/{y}.png,0.9,geojson/1868fltcombinedland.geojson,weight:2;color:gray;opacity:.6;fillColor:white;fillOpacity:0

After a grueling march lasting about two weeks and covering nearly two hundred and thirty miles in total, the expedition reached a picturesque valley with good grass and plenty of wood that was situated along a branch of the Little Missouri River. The New York Tribune described what a “great relief” it was to arrive at this place, and everyone “rejoiced” when Custer “wisely” decided to rest there for a day, including “the mules and the horses.” Private Ewert explained that a rest day was especially welcome because “the rank and file” had been ordered to bring just a single change of under-clothes, meaning that each had been worn without washing for a whole week. Another factor that may have contributed to Custer's decision was that mineral prospectors believed the small river was likely to yield gold. As soldiers washed their underwear, the miners dug down as far as the bedrock. Although they failed to strike pay dirt, Custer still named the site “Prospect Valley.”<br></br>

Expedition geologists had more luck compared to the mineral prospectors. About ten miles from the camp, George Bird Grinell found a Badlands formation called Castle Butte (on account of its resemblance to a medieval castle) that contained several vertebrate fossils. In addition to turtle bones, he also unearthed a large femur that was badly crushed and flattened during the process of fossilization. An article in the NY Tribune speculated that an “aged mammoth, a great deal older than Methusaleh, among his peers quite as respectable, had laid himself down to a final sleep, and, fortunately for us, had left one leg sticking out of the bed.” Although Grinell worked with great care to exhume the large fossil, which measured about four feet in length and almost one foot in diameter, the “many centuries of enforced seclusion” had left it “too weak to endure its sudden exposure, and a large part of it crumbled to pieces.” Although he initially assumed that it belonged to a Mastodon, after comparing the specimen to others collected in the same beds, Grinell eventually concluded that “it was the femur of a dinosaur.”<br></br>

Smoke signals caused a great deal of excitement in camp as well. A journalist for the NY World saw them emanating from behind the camp: “three smokes, one considerably to the left of the other two, signaling the line of our march and the fact that there are no more of us coming.” In his official dispatch, Custer agreed, interpreting the smoke signals “as carrying information to the main body of our presence and movements.” While some of Native scouts were certain that Sitting Bull planned to “make a stand at the Hills,” Custer reminded everyone that because “I sent pacific messages to all the tribes infesting this region,” it was more likely the smoke signals “may have simply been made to enable the villages to avoid us.” In his diary, Private Ewert marveled that “In the art of smoke signals the redman is a perfect master, and his code of signals is nearly as complete as our own at the signal office at Washington. Every member of the camp is expecting a battle within the next few days as war and warpath are about the only two words talked about.”<br></br>

Interestingly, a journalist for the NY World commented that while expedition soldiers busied themselves with debates about how to interpret the meaning of smoke signals, Lakotan and Arikaran scouts were preoccupied with a comet they had seen for the past several nights. Convinced that it represented a portentous omen, particularly since “the prophets of the Sioux have been unrelentingly preaching a crusade of extermination against the whites,” they warned that “the spirits of the dead are upon the war-path.”",Cross-referenced.,,,,https://cawm.lib.uiowa.edu/tiles/{z}/{x}/{y}.png,0.9,geojson/1868fltcombinedland.geojson,weight:2;color:gray;opacity:.6;fillColor:white;fillOpacity:0
